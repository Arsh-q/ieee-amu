                    Being a SSGSA awardee and a proud member of the family, I
                    feel very much privileged. SSGSA not only made me dream big
                    but also helped me to attain success. I am really amazed to
                    observe the working style of this family and the extent to
                    which they cooperate with the students.
                    <br />
                    The struggles of these seniors from the Aligarh fraternity
                    were a great source of inspiration to me and as a result of
                    this motivation, I got selected for an internship at
                    European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva,
                    Switzerland which, I believe, is the best thing to have
                    happened to me so far. CERN is not only the world's largest
                    Physics laboratory but also one of the most prestigious
                    research institutes of the world.
                    <br />
                    Had I not got the SSGSA award, I probably wouldn't have got
                    the motivation to apply there (in CERN) too. So, all credit
                    goes to SSGSA, which changed my perceptions, dreams and
                    motivations of life.
