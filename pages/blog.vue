        'The session was orated by Dr Khaliqur Rehman, Assistant Professor, Electrical Engineering Dept, ZHCET, AMU and attended by more than 170 students from various undergraduate and postgraduate courses. He began with the emphasis on the writing process and the structure of a research paper. His main focus was on proper planning and designing, evaluation and interpretation of data obtained, research ethics, statistical analysis  and the practical application of the writings. Dr Khaliq advised against publishing very old research papers, non-previewed publications and the use self cited old papers.The session was also marked by the doubts raised by the students.Mr Mohd.Zaid concluded the session and asked the students to interact with the office bearers of IEEE studentâ€™s branch for their queries.'
